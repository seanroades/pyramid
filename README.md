# The pyramid network

The pyramid network is a cryptocurrency that rewards people for bringing others into the network.

# How it works

A person can only join the pyramid network upon invitation. 

As a part of the network, you can invite friends to join by simply putting in their address into the pyramid's frontend (in another repo). They can then enter your address to confirm that you invited them and join the network.

Upon joining the network, they will recieve 5 triangles. The person who invited them will also recieve 5 triangles and so on up to 16 levels. 

Users can claim 2 triangles when they would like for free (minus the gas fee). 

Users can also trade triangles amongst themselves.

Currently the pyramid network is not servicable via an exchange but perhaps in the future, you will be able to exchange your triangles for USD or the other cryptocurrency of your choice.
