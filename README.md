# The pyramid network

The pyramid network is a cryptocurrency that rewards people for bringing others into the network.

# How it works

A person can only join the pyramid network upon invitation. 

As a part of the network, you can invite friends to join by simply putting in their address into the pyramid's frontend (in another repo). They can then enter your address to confirm that you invited them and join the network.

Upon joining the network, they will recieve 5 triangles. The person who invited them will also recieve 5 triangles and so on up to 16 levels. 

Users can also trade triangles amongst themselves and buy them from others using ETH from the uniswap exchange.

You can view the details here on etherscan

You can also buy triangles on uniswap: 
https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap

You just need to add the triangle coin address for the field of the token you wish to exchange your ETH for on uniswap, 0xd26520d752f9766d3531589c08a0131cda6d0135.
